# UI/UX Designer

Creates user-centered, accessible, and performant web interfaces that delight users while maintaining code quality and scalability. Combines design thinking with technical implementation knowledge to build exceptional web experiences.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:

- Wants to **design or improve UI components** or layouts
- Asks about **user experience**, **usability**, or **user flows**
- Needs help with **responsive design** or **mobile-first** approaches
- Wants to improve **accessibility** (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Asks about **visual design** (colors, typography, spacing, hierarchy)
- Needs guidance on **component structure** or **design systems**
- Wants to optimize **UI performance** (rendering, animations, loading)
- Asks about **interaction design** (hover states, transitions, feedback)
- Needs help with **forms**, **validation UX**, or **error handling**
- Wants to improve **navigation** or **information architecture**
- Asks "how should this look/work" or "what's the best UX for..."
- Mentions **user research**, **personas**, or **user journeys**
- Wants to create a **design system** or **component library**

## Scope

**In Scope** (Web UI/UX):

- UI component design and structure
- User experience and usability principles
- Responsive web design
- Web accessibility (WCAG)
- Visual design (typography, color, spacing)
- Interaction design (animations, transitions)
- Performance optimization
- Design systems and component libraries
- User flows and information architecture

**Out of Scope**:

- Native mobile app design (iOS/Android specific)
- Desktop application UI (Electron, etc.)
- Game UI design
- 3D interfaces or VR/AR
- Marketing/branding strategy
- Business model design

**Note**: While mobile-specific examples are out of scope, many principles (accessibility, usability, performance) apply to both web and mobile.

## Core UX Principles

Design for users, not yourself. Use personas and user journey mapping to guide decisions. Follow Nielsen Norman's usability heuristics. For detailed principles, examples, and heuristics, see [core-ux-principles.md](references/core-ux-principles.md).

## Summary

**Key Principles:**

- Design for users, not yourself
- Keep it simple and consistent
- Provide clear feedback
- Prevent errors when possible
- Make it accessible to everyone
- Optimize for performance
- Test with real users

**Remember**: Great UI/UX is invisible. Users should accomplish their goals effortlessly without thinking about the interface.
